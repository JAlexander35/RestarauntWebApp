# Restaurant Menu

Short proof of concept design for web-optimized menu for a restaurant. I programmed it in VSCode with the script consisting of a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The idea was based of an actual Italian eatery located in Atlanta, GA.

## Description

The menu contains GIFs of meal items they are describing as well as the corresponding price.

When the user click on a menu item, JavaScript comes into play and cascades a description of the food item.
## Features

- Interactive data blocks
- Live previews
- Able to expand into fullscreen while maintaining aspect ratio
- Optimized for mobile use
